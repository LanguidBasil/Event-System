# Event-System
 
[Observer](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

It's a very powerful instrument for escaping dependencies, so much that Java added it into core library (java.util.Observer/java.util.Observable) and C# embededded it directly into language (event keyword). Yet in C++ you need to implement it yourself, and so I did!
